# Cricket Performance Prediction

This project aims to model and predict the total career runs scored by cricket players using statistical and machine learning techniques in R. 

## Objective
To explore key batting features and evaluate different regression models—including linear regression, interaction terms, polynomial regression, Ridge, and Lasso—to determine the best predictors for career performance.

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation and distribution plots
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (up to 15th degree)
- Interaction Term Modeling
- Ridge and Lasso Regularization
- Cross-Validation
- RMSE, MAE, and R-squared evaluation

## Files
- `Harnika_Pendyala_Cricket_Run_Prediction_Report.docx`: Final report with interpretation
- `Harnika_Pendyala_Cricket_Run_Prediction_Code.R`: Full modeling and analysis code
- `data/cricket_dataset.csv`: Cleaned dataset used in modeling (if sharable)

## Results Summary
Models were evaluated on test data using RMSE, MAE, and R². Ridge and Lasso showed robust performance, with the interaction model (Model 3) achieving the best balance of interpretability and fit.

## Tools & Libraries
- R, ggplot2, caret, glmnet, car, Metrics
- Visualization and residual diagnostics for model validation
