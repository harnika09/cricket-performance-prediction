# Cricket Performance Prediction

This project uses statistical modeling in R to predict a cricket player’s total career runs based on historical performance metrics such as matches played, highest score, centuries, and batting average.

We applied multiple regression techniques including:
- Linear Regression
- Interaction Terms
- Polynomial Regression (degrees 2 to 15)
- Regularization with Ridge and Lasso

Models were evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² on test data. Lasso Regression and Interaction Model 3 provided the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.
